# Exercises

1. Concatenate two text strings with the operator (.) and print the result.

2. Develop a program that add two variables stored in two different variables.

3. Develop a program that show the PHP information with the function `phpinfo()`. Show this information horizontally centered.

4. Show a $10x10$ table with numbers from 1 to 100.

5. Do the same that in the `4.` but coloring the rows grey and white. The size will be different `define(TAM,10)`.

6. Show a $4x4$ table that shows the first 4 powers of the first 4 numbers (develop a function using the `pow` function). In PHP you have to define the functions before invoking it. The parameters are indicated by name or preceded by `&` if you are passing the parameters by reference.

7. Store the first 10 natural even numbers in a vector. Print it each one in a new line (remember the HTML tag <br>)

8. Print the values of the next associative vector using the foreach control statement: 
```
$v[1] = 90;
$v[30] = 7;
$v['e'] = 99;
$v['hola'] = 43;
```

9. Develop a program that shows in a 4 column table every images into the images folder.

10. Do the same than the exercise $9$ but rescale the images to $100x100$ and when you click on it open a full view of it. Check that only show the images with extensions `.jpg`, `.png`, `bmp` or `.gif` (develop a function to check the extensions using regular expressions.)
